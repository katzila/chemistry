    "aboutText": "<mainBody>Chemistry is a fascinating subject, but not all students can easily understand it. Therefore, our team of developers decided to create an online workbook that includes brief reference material on the required topics. The workbook consists of two sections for 10th and 11th grade material: organic and inorganic chemistry. In these sections, you can find both reference material (substances, their structural formulas, properties, applications, methods of production, and even ball-and-stick models) and problems on various topics.</mainBody><subText>We hope you will find it interesting to explore chemistry with our workbook, so we wish you good luck!</subText>"
